# La Relance
## Visualizing Quebec University students hiring rate.

[La Relance](http://proj.nddery.ca/la-relance/)

La Relance is an interactive data visualisation that explores the hiring rate of
Quebec University students, by University, as well as by programs. It compares
universities and programs to each others. It also looks at  the number of people
with jobs, the amount of time it took them to find said job, their weekly
salary and the relation with their studied field.
