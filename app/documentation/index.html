        <p class="lead">Visualizing Quebec University students hiring rate.</p>
        <p>La Relance is an interactive data visualisation that explores the hiring rate of Quebec University students, by University, as well as by programs. It compares universities and programs to each others. It also looks at the number of people with jobs, the amount of time it took them to find the said job, their weekly salary, and the relation with the studied field.</p>

  <!-- IndexedDB
================================================== -->
  <section id="IDB">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1>IndexedDB</h1>
    </div>

    <!-- Headings & Paragraph Copy -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span8">
        <h2>Why IndexedDB?</h2>
        <p>For this project, I decided I needed an in-browser database to speed
        things up. Having to query the server every time I needed more data would
        of been (much simpler for me) but the end user might have noticed
        a certain lag between requesting information and the information
        actually being displayed. For this reason, speed, I decided to start
        looking at possibilities for in-browser database. Having worked a lot
        with MySQL, WebSQL was obviously my first
        choice. However, I soon discovered that it had been deprecated back in
        2010, replaced with something called IndexedDB.</p>

        <h2>(Index)edDB</h2>
        <p>As the name suggest, IndexedDB does not use Structured Query Language
        (SQL), instead it uses queries on an index that produces a cursor, which
        you use to iterate across the result set. This <strong>NoSQL</strong>
        way of doing things was completely new to me. I knew it was supposed to
        be much faster than SQL though - so that was quite comforting.</p>

        <h2>Some note on browser support</h2>
        <p>IndexedDB is still in its infant years, it is not supported by most
        browsers and even the browsers that supports it do not in the same
        manner. This has lead me to many head-scratching time-consuming
        problems. I am solely testing on Firefox 18 and Chrome 24 for the moment.</p>

        <p>As of the date of writing this, supported browsers were as follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mozilla Firefox
            <ul>
              <li>16.0</li>
              <li>4.0 <code>-moz</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Google Chrome
            <ul>
              <li>24.0</li>
              <li>11.0 <code>-webkit</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Internet Explorer 10
            <ul>
              <li>10 <code>-ms</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Safari
            <ul>
              <li>Not supported</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Opera
            <ul>
              <li>Not supported</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Mobile support is only available in Firefox Mobile 6.0
        <code>-moz</code>.</p>

        <h2>The asynchronous nature of IndexedDB</h2>
        <p>One of the most difficult problem I had to circumvent was to find
        a solution to the asynchronous nature of IndexedDB. Asynchronous tasks
        is something I've always had trouble with in Javascript, how to properly
        handle AJAX callbacks is another exception of my difficulty with the
        concept. Deferred &amp; promises is something I still have to fully wrap my
        head around.</p>

        <p>In IndexedDB, everything is done through <strong>requests</strong>. You
        request open a database, you request to add data to an object store.
        The basic way to go about IndexedDB is as follow:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open the database;</li>
          <li>Create an object store;</li>
          <li>Make a request to do some database operation, like adding or
          retrieving data;</li>
          <li>Wait for the operation to complete by listening to the right kind
          of DOM event;</li>
          <li>Do something with the results.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Problem comes when you try and retrieve data before you have finished
        creating the correct database schema and adding all you data to it. This
        will throw an error. At first, I tried to open the database, add data to
        it via AJAX and then listen for the <code>oncomplete</code> call to
        start querying the database. However, because both IndexedDB and AJAX
        are asynchronous, when I started the AJAX call, the database became
        inactive and hence closed the transaction, calling the
        <code>oncomplete</code> method - leading me to believe I could safely
        access the data. I asked on StackOverflow and here is <a
        href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14907761/2077298" title="Kristof
        Degrave answer on the subject">Kristof Degrave answer on the
        subject</a>.</p>

        <p>To remedy this behavior, I decided to pre-fetch my data and only when
        I had successfully retrieve all data, open the database. Then, if there
        was a need to update the database structure, it would be done
        synchronously, removing all place for error.</p>

        <p>I am using d3.js to produce the visualization of data. D3

        <p>AngularJS will take care for me of much of the binding to the DOM, I only have to concentrate on the user interaction and the display of information then.</p>
